Simple Zendesk Client that:

1. Creates a user
2. Creates a ticket with that user as requester
3. Marks that ticket as solved (coming)

You can create a Zendesk account by signing up at http://www.zendesk.com/

In the lib folder there is an implementation of Zendesk Rest API (tickets and users) using rest-client (http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client) and hpricot (https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot).

Implemented with Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/).
