Simple Zendesk Client that:

1. Creates a user
2. Creates a ticket with that user as requester
3. Marks that ticket as solved (coming, but works for the API)

You can create a Zendesk account by signing up at http://www.zendesk.com/

In the lib folder there is an implementation of Zendesk Rest API (tickets and users) using rest-client (http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client) and hpricot (https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot).

Implemented with Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

===

To run:

You need the sinatra and bundler gems installed.
gem install bundler
gem install sinatra 
(if don't work, try sudo)

Install dependencies with bundler:
bundle install
(or 'bundle install --path folder_name' to install to an alternate location)

bundle exec ruby client.rb

Go to your browser and access:
http://localhost:4567/

Or you can use shotgun for source file reloading (recommended for developing):
bundle exec shotgun client.rb

===

Usage (implementation of Zendesk Rest API):

require 'rest_client' 

resource = ZenAPI.new 'https://your_help_desk.zendesk.com/', 'your_user', 'password'
resource.list 'tickets'
resource.list 'users'
resource.create 'tickets', xml
resource.update 'tickets', id, xml
resource.delete 'tickets', id

Or you can use the Tickets/Ticket and Users/User classes, which require the ZenAPi. In this case, just change how your user/pwd is informed (have a look at Tickets::initializer and Users::initializer). The classes provide ways to deal with the XML, which should be easier than accessing the ZenAPI directly.

TODO:

* Change status should be ajax/post
* Deal with exceptions (rest-client)
* Show user tickets instead of all tickets
